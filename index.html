                <p class="letter-salutation">Dear Sheen,</p>
                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>I like you, I really do. From when I laid my eyes on you when you arrived, I knew I fell for you,
                        and trust me I did a good job hiding it, but I can't anymore. Cause I'd rather take the risk
                        than let it all go.</p>
                    <p>I like you Sheen, I like you a lot. And I know its crazy as it sounds but that's the truth,
                        trust. I know I am far too away from your standards, even though I don't know them. But at least
                        I can at least be a guy, who's becoming a man.</p>
                    <p>I don't know how to dress, nor how to impress. I just act like how I am, but with you I am
                        speechless. Though yes I talk and tease, its just to hide what I feel. Cause I'm scared that if
                        I didn't, they'd laugh at me through their heels. I like you Sheen, more than words can express.
                        I may never look like it but I'm just too scared to confess. And a friend said I should, be
                        brave and face it. But I can't tell you directly, so this letter is my way of saying.</p>
                    <p>Not every word can rhyme, not every poem can be understood. So maybe make it simple, and make it
                        sound mature. But there's more to what I feel, that even words can't comprehend, and I can't
                        show you clearly, cause well that'd create a trend. A bad one.</p>
                    <p>So this letter I give you, isn't just a love letter. Its a love poem, though I figured you won't
                        even begin to differ. But you just reading this makes me happy, more than happy that's the
                        truth. So the next question is something, I took a week to conclude.</p>
